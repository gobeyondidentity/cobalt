The Fragmented Pane: A Deep Dive into Management Architectures for NVIDIA BlueField DPUsExecutive SummaryThe integration of Data Processing Units (DPUs) into the modern data center represents a fundamental architectural shift, transitioning from CPU-centric compute models to data-centric infrastructure where networking, security, and storage services are offloaded, accelerated, and isolated. This shift, epitomized by the NVIDIA BlueField platform, introduces a profound management paradox: while the DPU enhances the security and efficiency of the host server by decoupling infrastructure from tenant workloads, it simultaneously creates a "black box" operational challenge. The DPU is effectively a server within a server—a distinct computing node with its own operating system, arm cores, and control plane—that requires its own sophisticated management and observability stack.The core objective of this research report is to determine the existence of a "Unified Management Dashboard" capable of providing holistic visibility and control over NVIDIA BlueField DPUs, with specific requirements for visualizing Open vSwitch (OVS) flow rules, verifying DICE/SPDM attestation chains, and monitoring host introspection data.The comprehensive analysis of the current software landscape reveals that no single, monolithic "single pane of glass" currently exists that natively aggregates granular OVS flow logic, raw cryptographic attestation chains, and host introspection alerts into one unified executable dashboard. Instead, NVIDIA has architected a composite management ecosystem. This ecosystem relies on a modular set of services—primarily the DOCA (Data Center Infrastructure-on-a-Chip Architecture) framework, DOCA BlueMan, NVIDIA Base Command Manager, and NVIDIA Mission Control—which collectively provide the requisite visibility when integrated with industry-standard observability platforms.The investigation identifies a stratified approach to visibility:Local Device Operations: Managed via DOCA BlueMan, a web-based dashboard running on the DPU that consolidates health, telemetry, and basic configuration.1Network Visibility (OVS): Achieved not through a static dashboard but through a dynamic observability pipeline using the DOCA Telemetry Service (DTS) to feed Prometheus/Grafana, and specialized debugging tools like ovs-flowviz for logic visualization.3Trust and Attestation (DICE/SPDM): Managed primarily via Redfish APIs and OpenBMC interfaces rather than a native GUI, necessitating integration with external Policy Decision Points (PDPs) or Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems for visualization.5Host Introspection (Argus): Designed as a "headless" sensor service that streams JSON/Syslog data to external analytics platforms like NVIDIA Morpheus or Splunk, deliberately lacking a local user interface to maintain stealth and security isolation.7This report provides an exhaustive technical breakdown of these tools, analyzing their architecture, capabilities, and integration points. It serves as a definitive guide for infrastructure architects seeking to synthesize these disparate data streams into a cohesive operational view.1. The Operational Context of DPU ManagementTo fully appreciate the landscape of tools available for managing NVIDIA BlueField DPUs, one must first deconstruct the unique operational context these devices create. A BlueField DPU is not merely a "SmartNIC"; it is a fully integrated system-on-chip (SoC) combining ConnectX network silicon with powerful Arm CPU cores. This architecture creates a dual-entity server environment—the x86 Host Node and the Arm DPU Node—operating in parallel within the same physical chassis.1.1 The Two-Node Management ProblemIn traditional data center management, the "server" is the atomic unit of management. Monitoring agents running on the host OS (e.g., Linux or Windows) have full visibility into the CPU, memory, storage, and network interface cards. However, the introduction of the DPU disrupts this model. When infrastructure services such as the software-defined firewall (e.g., OVS), storage virtualization (e.g., NVMe-oF), or security monitoring (e.g., Argus) are offloaded to the DPU, they move effectively "out of sight" of the host OS.The host CPU sees the DPU only as a PCIe device (typically a standard NIC). It cannot inspect the processes running on the DPU's Arm cores, nor can it see the network flows that are offloaded to the DPU's hardware switch. This creates a visibility gap where critical infrastructure operations are opaque to legacy host-based monitoring tools. Consequently, the DPU requires its own independent management plane, effectively doubling the number of managed endpoints in the data center.1.2 The Control Plane ArchitectureManagement of BlueField DPUs is bifurcated into two distinct control planes, each serving different operational needs and requiring different tooling.1.2.1 The In-Band Control PlaneThe in-band plane utilizes the high-speed data network interfaces (the uplink ports) for management traffic. This is the primary channel for high-volume telemetry streaming, application data, and operational metrics. Tools like the DOCA Telemetry Service (DTS) utilize this plane to export thousands of counters per second to centralized collectors like Prometheus. The advantage of in-band management is bandwidth; identifying micro-bursts or capturing full packet traces requires the multi-gigabit throughput that only the data plane can provide. However, relying solely on in-band management is risky; if the network configuration on the DPU fails (e.g., a misconfigured OVS rule drops all traffic), the management channel is lost.1.2.2 The Out-of-Band (OOB) Control PlaneTo mitigate the risks of in-band management, BlueField DPUs are equipped with a dedicated Out-of-Band (OOB) management port (typically a 1GbE RJ45 interface) and an integrated Baseboard Management Controller (BMC).8 This OOB plane is the lifeline for lifecycle management. It allows administrators to:Power cycle the DPU independently of the host.Update firmware and bootloaders (ATF/UEFI) even when the OS is unresponsive.Access the DPU's serial console for debugging.Perform remote attestation (SPDM) to verify the device's integrity before allowing it to join the main network.The OOB plane is governed by standard protocols such as IPMI and Redfish, ensuring compatibility with existing data center management systems. However, bandwidth on this channel is limited, making it unsuitable for streaming real-time flow telemetry or memory introspection logs.1.3 The "Unified Dashboard" RequirementThe user's request for a "Unified Dashboard" arises from the friction of managing these two planes and multiple functional domains (Network, Security, Trust) separately. An ideal unified dashboard would need to:Aggregate: Collect data from both the host (via agents) and the DPU (via DOCA).Correlate: Link a specific VM on the host to the specific OVS flows offloaded to the DPU.Visualize: Present complex cryptographic trust chains (DICE/SPDM) in a human-readable format.Alert: Provide real-time notifications for security breaches detected by host introspection.While NVIDIA offers powerful tools like Base Command Manager for fleet management and Mission Control for cloud operations 9, the granular "deep dive" visibility into specific OVS rules or memory scans is often delegated to specialized tools or third-party integrations. The subsequent chapters of this report analyze these specific tools in detail.2. Local Device Visibility: The Role of DOCA BlueManFor administrators managing individual DPUs or small clusters, the DOCA BlueMan service serves as the primary "native" dashboard. It acts as the local control panel for the DPU, providing a graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize the device's operational state.2.1 Architecture and DeploymentDOCA BlueMan is a containerized web application designed to run directly on the BlueField DPU's Arm operating system.1 It effectively transforms the DPU into a managed appliance with its own web-based administrative interface.Deployment: The service is deployed as part of the standard DOCA runtime environment or can be pulled from the NVIDIA NGC catalog. It typically listens on a dedicated management port (e.g., 10000) accessible via the OOB network.1Backend: BlueMan does not collect metrics directly. Instead, it relies on the DOCA Telemetry Service (DTS) as its data source. DTS runs as a background daemon, polling hardware counters, system sensors, and software drivers, and exposing them via an API that BlueMan consumes.2 This separation of presentation (BlueMan) and collection (DTS) allows for flexibility; the same DTS data can be sent to both BlueMan and a remote Grafana server simultaneously.2.2 Operational CapabilitiesBlueMan provides a consolidated view of "Day 1" and "Day 2" operational metrics, focusing on health, configuration, and performance.2.2.1 System Health MonitoringThe dashboard features a "Health" section that aggregates critical system indicators into a simplified traffic-light status (Pass/Warning/Fail).2Resource Utilization: Real-time tracking of CPU usage across the Arm cores, memory consumption, and storage I/O on the boot devices (eMMC/NVMe).Thermal and Power: Monitoring of on-die thermal sensors and power rail consumption, critical for preventing thermal throttling in dense server deployments.Service Status: The dashboard verifies the status of essential systemd services, such as openvswitch-switch, doca-telemetry-service, and hardware drivers.A significant feature of BlueMan is its customizable health thresholds. Administrators can edit the blueman_config.ini file to define specific ranges for health states.2 For example:Ini, TOML[Health:CPU_Usages:Pass] range = 0,80
 range = 80,90
[Health:CPU_Usages:Failed] range = 90,100
This allows the dashboard's "Green/Red" status to align with the specific Service Level Agreements (SLAs) or performance envelopes of the deployment environment.2.2.2 System and Firmware InformationBlueMan serves as a central repository for static device data, eliminating the need to run multiple CLI commands (ibv_devinfo, mst status, uname -a).Identity: Displays Board ID, Serial Number, and Part Number.Software Versions: Shows the current version of the BlueField OS, the Linux kernel, and the installed DOCA SDK libraries.Firmware Management: Crucially, it displays mlxconfig parameters, showing both the current running configuration and the next boot configuration. This is vital for verifying that firmware setting changes (e.g., enabling Zero Trust mode or changing link speeds) have been correctly staged.22.3 Telemetry VisualizationWhile BlueMan is not a full-scale analytics platform, it provides immediate visual feedback on network performance via its integration with DTS.Port Counters: It displays detailed statistics for both the physical uplink ports (p0, p1) and the virtual functions (VFs) exposed to the host. Metrics include throughput (Gbps), packet rates (PPS), and error counters (CRC errors, drops, discards).Graphing: The interface allows users to select specific counters and generate simple time-series graphs, enabling quick visual identification of traffic spikes or sustained load patterns.112.4 Limitations of BlueManDespite its utility, DOCA BlueMan has distinct limitations that prevent it from being the sole unified dashboard for enterprise operations:Single-Device Scope: BlueMan manages one DPU at a time. It does not provide a centralized view of a fleet. Managing 1,000 DPUs would require opening 1,000 browser tabs.Lack of Application Logic: It excels at showing counters (e.g., "10,000 packets received") but struggles with logic (e.g., "Why did packet X get dropped by OVS rule Y?"). It does not inherently visualize complex OVS flow tables or attestation chains.Security Isolation: For high-security environments, the web interface may be disabled entirely to reduce the attack surface, forcing administrators to rely on headless APIs or CLI tools.3. Network Visibility and The OVS "Blind Spot"The user's query specifically highlights the need for visibility into OVS (Open vSwitch) rules. This is one of the most technically challenging aspects of DPU management due to the aggressive hardware offloading technologies employed by NVIDIA BlueField.3.1 The Visibility Challenge: Hardware Offload (ASAP²)NVIDIA BlueField DPUs utilize a technology known as ASAP² (Accelerated Switching and Packet Processing). This technology offloads OVS packet processing from the software kernel (or userspace) to the dedicated eSwitch (Embedded Switch) silicon within the ConnectX network controller.12The Mechanism: When a packet flow is established, OVS pushes the flow rule down to the hardware. Subsequent packets in that flow are matched and forwarded entirely by the silicon, bypassing the Arm CPU cores and the OS kernel.The "Blind Spot": Traditional network monitoring tools like tcpdump or standard OVS kernel tracing run on the CPU. Because offloaded packets never reach the CPU, these tools cannot see them. An administrator running ovs-appctl dpctl/dump-flows might see a flow rule, but the packet counters in software might read "0," falsely implying the flow is inactive, while in reality, the hardware is processing millions of packets per second.3.2 Bridging the Gap: DOCA Telemetry Service (DTS)To solve the visibility gap, NVIDIA provides the DTS OVS Provider. This component is critical for any "unified dashboard" strategy.3Architecture: The OVS provider queries the hardware eSwitch counters directly, mapping the hardware flow IDs back to the high-level OVS flow rules.Metrics Export: It exports comprehensive metrics including:ovs_dp_flows_total: The total number of flows in the datapath.ovs_dp_flows_offloaded: The number of flows successfully offloaded to hardware.ovs_flow_packets / ovs_flow_bytes: Aggregate counters for traffic processed by specific flows.ovs_flow_hits / ovs_flow_misses: Critical for debugging performance issues where flows are falling back to the slower software path.Visualization: These metrics are designed to be consumed by Prometheus and visualized in Grafana. While there is no "out-of-the-box" dashboard shipped inside the DPU, NVIDIA provides reference Grafana dashboards that visualize these Prometheus metrics, effectively creating a "Network Visibility Dashboard" that shows real-time offload efficiency and traffic patterns.33.3 Deep Dive Debugging: ovs-flowvizFor detailed logic analysis—answering why traffic is behaving a certain way—counters are insufficient. Administrators need to visualize the complex hierarchy of flow tables, matches, and actions. The tool of choice here is ovs-flowviz.4Functionality: ovs-flowviz is a Python-based visualization utility included with newer versions of OVS. It parses openflow and datapath flow dumps to create structured visual representations.Visualization Formats:Console: It provides color-coded, structured text output in the CLI, making it easier to read complex match fields and actions compared to raw dump text.Datapath Trees: It can arrange flows into a hierarchical tree based on recirc_id (recirculation ID), which is essential for understanding the multi-stage processing pipelines common in virtualized networks (e.g., VXLAN encap/decap).Graphviz/HTML: Perhaps most relevant to the user's request for a dashboard, ovs-flowviz can generate interactive HTML files containing SVG graphs of the flow logic.15 These visual maps show the relationships between different flow tables and how packets traverse the logical switch.Integration Insight: While ovs-flowviz is a CLI tool, its HTML output can be hosted on a web server or integrated into a CI/CD pipeline artifact viewer, creating a static "snapshot dashboard" of the network state for auditing or troubleshooting.3.4 OVN-Kubernetes and Network ObservabilityIn Kubernetes environments like Red Hat OpenShift, OVS is orchestrated by OVN (Open Virtual Network). The management paradigm here shifts to the Network Observability Operator.eBPF limitations: Modern cloud-native observability often relies on eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) to trace flows. On BlueField, eBPF running on the Arm cores can only see exception traffic.IPFIX/NetFlow: To achieve full visibility, the DPU hardware (ConnectX) is configured to sample flows and generate IPFIX records. These records are sent to an external collector (e.g., the Network Observability Operator in OpenShift) which then visualizes the flows in the OpenShift Console.16Skydive: Another tool referenced in the ecosystem is Skydive, a real-time network topology and flow analyzer.18 Skydive captures the network structure (ports, bridges, namespaces) and overlays flow metrics, providing a dynamic visual map of the OVS infrastructure.4. The Trust Architecture: Visualizing DICE and SPDM AttestationThe user's requirement for control over "DICE/SPDM attestation" addresses the critical need for Zero Trust verification. BlueField DPUs act as the root of trust for the server, but visualizing this trust status requires understanding the underlying cryptographic protocols.4.1 The Mechanics of TrustDICE (Device Identifier Composition Engine): This is a TCG (Trusted Computing Group) standard implemented in the BlueField hardware. During boot, a unique "Compound Device Identifier" (CDI) is generated based on the cryptographic measurement of the hardware and the initial firmware stages. Each layer measures the next layer (Hardware -> Bootloader -> OS), creating a chain of trust.20SPDM (Security Protocol and Data Model): This is the wire protocol used to communicate these measurements to an external verifier. A requester (e.g., a BMC or Switch) sends an SPDM GET_CERTIFICATE command, and the DPU responds with its certificate chain and signed measurements.54.2 The "Dashboard" Gap in TrustA key finding of this research is that there is no native "Trust Dashboard" GUI on the DPU itself. The DPU is the prover, not the verifier. It does not "see" its own trust status; it simply provides evidence to others.BlueField BMC Limitations: While the BlueField BMC (Baseboard Management Controller) serves as the hardware manager, its web UI typically does not feature a "DICE Visualization" tab.6 The support for Redfish schemas related to SPDM is often strictly API-based.Complexity: The BlueField-3 attestation chain is complex, involving Layers 1-4 (Pre-provisioned by NVIDIA) and Layers 5-6 (Generated at runtime).22 Visualizing this requires a tool capable of parsing x.509 extensions and CoRIM (Concise Reference Integrity Manifest) tags.4.3 Visualization via IntegrationsThe "Unified Dashboard" for attestation is effectively the dashboard of the external Verifier platform.Redfish API Integration: Administrators must typically script against the Redfish API (e.g., /redfish/v1/Managers/Bluefield/Security/Certificates) to retrieve the attestation blobs.23Third-Party Verifiers: Platforms like F5 and Xage Security integrate with BlueField to enforce zero-trust policies. Their management consoles act as the dashboard, displaying the DPU as "Trusted" or "Untrusted" based on the background SPDM handshake.24UFM Cyber-AI: NVIDIA's Unified Fabric Manager (UFM) with the Cyber-AI add-on can ingest security telemetry. It allows administrators to visualize "Security Health" alerts if a DPU fails attestation or reports a firmware mismatch, effectively mapping trust status onto the data center topology.265. Host Introspection and Runtime Security (Argus)The final specific requirement is visibility into "Host Introspection." This capability allows the DPU to monitor the host server's memory and state without installing agents on the host, preventing malware from tampering with the monitoring tools.5.1 DOCA Argus ArchitectureThe primary tool for this is DOCA Argus. It utilizes the DPU's DMA (Direct Memory Access) engine to read host memory and scan for signatures of rootkits, code injection, or unauthorized process modifications.75.2 The Strategy of InvisibilityBy design, DOCA Argus does not have a user interface on the DPU. It operates as a "headless" background service to maintain stealth and reduce the attack surface. If it had a web GUI, that GUI could become a target for attackers.Output Format: Argus generates high-fidelity security alerts in JSON or Syslog formats.7 These logs contain specific details: the timestamp, the type of event (e.g., "Hooking"), the target process ID (PID) on the host, and the specific memory address involved.5.3 Building the Security DashboardTo visualize Argus data, the standard workflow mandates integration with centralized security analytics platforms.NVIDIA Morpheus: This is an AI application framework for cybersecurity. Morpheus can ingest the high-volume streaming telemetry from Argus, run AI inference to detect complex behavioral anomalies (e.g., "This process behavior matches a ransomware pattern"), and visualize the results in a unified Security Operations Center (SOC) dashboard.27SIEM Integration: The JSON logs are typically forwarded via Fluent Bit to enterprise SIEM platforms like Splunk, Elasticsearch, or CrowdStrike.29 In these platforms, security analysts build custom dashboards (e.g., "Host Integrity Monitor") that aggregate Argus alerts across the entire fleet.Key Insight: The "dashboard" for host introspection is not a new tool to buy; it is a new data source feeding into the organization's existing security glass pane.6. Fleet-Scale Orchestration: BCM, UFM, and Mission ControlWhile local tools like BlueMan cover single devices, managing thousands of DPUs requires fleet-scale orchestration. NVIDIA provides three key platforms that serve as "Unified Managers" at scale.6.1 NVIDIA Base Command Manager (BCM)Base Command Manager (formerly Bright Cluster Manager) is the foundational infrastructure management platform.9Lifecycle Management: BCM automates the provisioning of the DPU OS (BFB images), manages firmware updates, and configures network settings across the cluster.Unified View: It provides a comprehensive GUI showing the topology of the cluster, treating DPUs as distinct managed nodes alongside their hosts. It aggregates health metrics (via IPMI/Redfish) but typically stops short of visualizing internal application logic like OVS flows.6.2 NVIDIA Mission ControlMission Control is the newer, cloud-native control plane designed for "AI Factories".10SaaS Experience: It offers a modern, centralized interface for managing the lifecycle of AI infrastructure, including DPUs.Capabilities: Mission Control focuses on workload orchestration and high-level health. It integrates with Run:ai to manage AI jobs running on the cluster. While it provides excellent "macro" visibility (Cluster Health, Job Status), it relies on underlying telemetry services for "micro" visibility (individual packet flows).6.3 Unified Fabric Manager (UFM)UFM focuses specifically on the InfiniBand fabric connecting the DPUs.32Network Health: It visualizes the physical network topology, cable health, and congestion.Security Extensions: With the Cyber-AI module, UFM becomes a security dashboard, detecting anomalies in network behavior that might indicate a compromised DPU or a denial-of-service attack.267. The Partner Ecosystem: Virtualization and KubernetesMany organizations will consume BlueField DPUs not through bare-metal tools but through integrated platforms like VMware vSphere or Red Hat OpenShift.7.1 VMware vSphere Distributed Services Engine (DSE)In a VMware environment, vCenter acts as the unified dashboard.33Integration: DSE allows administrators to offload NSX networking services to the DPU directly from the vCenter UI.Visibility: vCenter provides a high-level view ("Offload Status: Active"), but deep introspection into the specific flow rules usually requires breaking out into NSX Manager or CLI tools. The user experience is seamless, but the visibility is abstracted.7.2 Red Hat OpenShiftIn Kubernetes environments, OpenShift manages the DPU via the DPU Operator.35Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs): The operator introduces CRDs that represent the DPU state. Administrators can query oc get dpu to see status.Observability: OpenShift's built-in observability stack (Prometheus/Grafana) is used to visualize metrics. The Network Observability Operator provides flow visualization within the OpenShift console, leveraging the IPFIX data exported by the DPU hardware.178. Conclusion and Strategic ArchitectureThe research confirms that there is no single "magic executable" that provides a unified dashboard for NVIDIA BlueField DPU operations, OVS rules, attestation, and introspection simultaneously. Instead, visibility is achieved through a Composite Architecture leveraging the DOCA Platform Framework.8.1 Summary of FindingsOperational Management: DOCA BlueMan provides excellent local visibility for health and basic telemetry. Base Command Manager provides this at fleet scale.Network Visibility: Is built, not bought. It relies on the DOCA Telemetry Service (DTS) feeding data to Grafana for metrics, and ovs-flowviz for deep-dive logic visualization.Attestation: Is managed via Redfish APIs and visualized primarily through external security verifiers (SIEMs, F5, Xage) rather than the DPU itself.Host Introspection: Is a headless data stream (JSON/Syslog) from DOCA Argus destined for SIEM ingestion (Splunk, Morpheus).8.2 Recommended ArchitectureTo achieve the "Unified Dashboard" requested, an organization should implement the following stack:Functional DomainPrimary ToolData SourceVisualization InterfaceDevice OperationsDOCA BlueManDTS / SysfsBlueMan Web UI / Base Command ManagerNetwork (OVS)DTS OVS ProviderHardware CountersGrafana (Metrics) / ovs-flowviz (HTML Logic)Trust (Attestation)Redfish APISPDM ProtocolThird-Party Verifier Dashboard / SIEMSecurity (Argus)DOCA ArgusDMA IntrospectionSplunk / NVIDIA Morpheus / CrowdStrikeBy integrating these components, an architect can construct a unified "Single Pane of Glass" within a platform like Grafana or Splunk, aggregating the modular outputs of the BlueField ecosystem into a comprehensive operational view. This "Build-it-Yourself" approach, while requiring initial integration effort, offers the flexibility and depth required to manage the complex, multi-domain nature of modern DPU-accelerated infrastructure.
